[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/npm-workspaces-tutorial?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Add a new library (e.g. my-angular-lib)

```sh
nx g @nx/angular:library libs/shared/my-angular-lib --importPath=@minatti/my-angular-lib --publishable
```


## Build all

```sh
npx nx run-many -t build
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Versioning and releasing

To version and release the library use

```
npx nx release
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what would happen without actually releasing the library.
